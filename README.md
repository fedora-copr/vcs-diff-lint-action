        with:
          sarif_file: ${{ steps.VCS_Diff_Lint.outputs.sarif }}
```

## Options

    linter_tags: <list of linter tags>
    debug: <true or false>

### subdirectory

### subdirectories

### linter_tags

Comma-separated list of linter tags (selectors) for the `vcs-diff-lint` utility (see the `--linter-tags` option). By default all linters are selected. Avaliable linter tags are `mypy`, `pylint`, and `python`.
